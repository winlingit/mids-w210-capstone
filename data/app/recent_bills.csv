The expanded summary of the House reported version is repeated here.) Establishes the congressional budget for the federal government for FY2018 and sets forth budgetary levels for FY2019-FY2027.  TITLE I--RECOMMENDED LEVELS AND AMOUNTS  (Sec. 101) Recommends levels and amounts for FY2018-FY2027 for:    Federal Revenues,  New Budget Authority,   Budget Outlays,   Deficits (On-Budget),   Debt Subject to Limit, and   Debt Held by the Public.   (Sec. 102) Recommends levels of new budget authority and outlays for FY2018-FY2027 for each major functional category, including:    National Defense;   International Affairs;   General Science, Space, and Technology;   Energy;   Natural Resources and Environment;   Agriculture;   Commerce and Housing Credit;   Transportation;   Community and Regional Development;   Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services;   Health;   Medicare;   Income Security;   Social Security;   Veterans Benefits and Services;   Administration of Justice;   General Government;   Net Interest;   Allowances;  Government-wide Savings and Adjustments;   Undistributed Offsetting Receipts;   Overseas Contingency Operations/ Global War on Terrorism; and   an Across-the-Board Adjustment.   TITLE II--RECONCILIATION AND RELATED MATTERS  (Sec. 201) Includes reconciliation instructions directing 11 House authorizing committees to submit to the House Budget Committee no later than October 6, 2017, legislation to reduce the deficit by specified amounts over FY2018-FY2027. (Under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)  TITLE III--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Subtitle A--Budget Enforcement  (Sec. 301) Requires the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to estimate whether legislation (other than appropriations measures) would cause a net increase in direct spending in excess of $2.5 billion over any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods beginning in FY2027. Establishes a point of order against legislation (other than appropriations measures) with a net effect of increasing direct spending by more than $2.5 billion in any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods. Specifies that this provision has no force or effect after September 30, 2018.  (Sec. 302) Provides the House Appropriations Committee with a separate allocation for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism and specifies procedures for enforcing and adjusting the allocation.  (Sec. 303) Establishes a point of order restricting the inclusion of certain changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) in appropriations legislation for FY2018-FY2020. Limits CHIMPs that reduce budget authority in the budget year but do not decrease outlays over the period of the total of the current year, budget year, and all fiscal years covered under the most recently agreed to budget resolution. Limit the CHIMPS to: $19.1 billion for FY2018, $17 billion for FY2019, and $15 billion for FY2020.  (Sec. 304) Prohibits advance appropriations unless: (1) the appropriation is provided for an account listed as an exception in the report accompanying this resolution, and (2) total advance appropriations do not exceed specified limits. (Under this resolution, an advance appropriation is any new discretionary budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for the fiscal year following FY2018.)  (Sec. 305) Permits the chair of the House Budget Committee to direct the CBO to include changes in debt service costs in estimates of legislation except for authorizations of discretionary programs or appropriation measures.  Specifies that: (1) this section applies to changes in the authorization level of appropriated entitlements, and (2) the estimates are advisory and may not be used for budget enforcement.  (Sec. 306) Requires the CBO, upon request of the chairman of the House Budget Committee, to include supplemental fair-value estimates in estimates for legislation establishing or modifying a loan or loan guarantee program.  Requires the CBO to provide a supplemental fair-value estimate for legislation establishing or modifying a loan or loan guarantee program for student financial assistance or housing (including residential mortgage).  Requires the CBO to include estimates, on a fair-value and credit reform basis, of loan and loan guarantee programs for student financial assistance, housing (including residential mortgage), and other major loan and loan guarantee programs in its ""Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2027.""  Permits the chairman of the House Budget Committee to use the fair-value estimates provided pursuant to this section for budget enforcement purposes.  (A fair-value estimate is an alternative to federal credit program estimates required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [FCRA]. Under FCRA, cash flows are discounted using Treasury interest rates for estimating subsidy costs. The fair-value method incorporates market risk by using market rates.)  (Sec. 307) Requires the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation to incorporate macroeconomic effects in estimates of specified legislation (commonly referred to as dynamic scoring).  (Sec. 308) Authorizes the chairman of the House Budget Committee to adjust committee allocations and levels in this resolution if legislation decreases direct spending in any fiscal year and authorizes appropriations for the same purpose.  (Sec. 309) Directs the CBO to estimate legislation that affects the use of energy savings performance contracts or utility energy service contracts on a net present value basis (in today's dollars) using calculations that meet specified requirements. Specifies that the contracts are to be scored as direct spending and that savings resulting from the contracts may be not be used as an offset for budget enforcement purposes.  (Under an energy savings performance contract, a private party agrees to fund energy-efficient upgrades for a federal facility, and the federal agency agrees to pay the private party from reductions in the agency's energy costs. Under a utility energy service contract, the services and equipment are provided by a utility.)  (Sec. 310) Requires transfers of funds from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund to be counted as new budget authority and outlays in the year the transfer occurs.  (Sec. 311) Prohibits transfers of surpluses of the Federal Reserve System from being counted as offsets for budget enforcement purposes. (This section prevents the transfers from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.)  (Sec. 312) Prohibits increases in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) guarantee fees from being used for budget enforcement purposes. (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages and charge the fees to guarantee the payment of principal and interest. This section prevents the fee increases from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.)  Subtitle B--Other Provisions  (Sec. 321) Specifies that the administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service are reflected in the allocation to the House Appropriations Committee to ensure that the committee retains control over the expenses through the annual appropriations process.  Requires the administrative expenses to be included in the cost estimates used to determine if an appropriations bill exceeds the spending limits in this resolution.  (Sec. 322) Sets forth procedures for the adjustment of allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary levels included in this resolution.  Permits the chairman of the House Budget Committee to adjust other appropriate levels in this concurrent resolution depending on congressional action on pending reconciliation legislation.  (Sec. 323) Authorizes the chair of the House Budget Committee to adjust the aggregates, allocations, and other levels in this resolution for any change in budgetary concepts and definitions pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.  (Sec. 324) Authorizes the chair of the House Budget Committee to adjust the aggregates, allocations, reconciliation targets, and other levels in this resolution for any changes that the CBO makes to its baseline for FY2018-FY2027.  (Sec. 325) Waives the point of order that would otherwise apply to appropriations legislation that exceeds the statutory limits on discretionary spending if the legislation would not cause this resolution's 302(a) allocation for the appropriations committee to be exceeded.  (Sec. 326) Affirms that the adoption of this budget resolution is an exercise of the House's rulemaking power and that the House has the constitutional right to change these rules.  TITLE IV--RESERVE FUNDS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Establishes reserve funds that permit the chairman of the House Budget Committee to adjust the levels and allocations included in the budget resolution to accommodate health, tax, and transportation legislation that meets specified conditions.  (Reserve funds provide the House Budget Committee Chairman with flexibility in applying budget enforcement rules to legislation that meets specified criteria.)  (Sec. 401) Establishes a reserve fund for legislation that commercializes the operations of the air traffic control system and reduces discretionary spending limits by the amount that would otherwise be appropriated to the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control.  (Sec. 402) Establishes a reserve fund for legislation that invests in national infrastructure and is deficit neutral over the period of FY2018-FY2027.  (Sec. 403) Establishes a reserve fund for legislation that provides for comprehensive tax reform and would not increase the deficit over the period of FY2018-FY2027.  (Sec. 404) Establishes a reserve fund for legislation that extends the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) allotments and would not increase the deficit over the period of FY2018-FY2027.  (Sec. 405) Establishes a reserve fund for legislation that repeals or replaces the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the health care-related provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.  TITLE V--POLICY STATEMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  (Sec. 501) States the policy of this resolution that Congress should propose a balanced budget constitutional amendment for ratification by the states.

Division B: Other Matters - (Sec. 1001) Requires the Secretary of HHS to: (1) ensure that American Health Benefit Exchanges (health care exchanges) verify that individuals applying for premium tax credits and reductions in cost-sharing for the purchase of qualified health benefit plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) are eligible for such credits and cost sharing reductions consistent with PPACA requirements; and (2) prior to making such credits and reductions available, certify to Congress that the Exchanges verify such eligibility. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress detailing the procedures employed by Exchanges to verify such eligibility.  Requires the Inspector General of HHS to report on the effectiveness of procedures and safeguards under PPACA for preventing the submission of inaccurate or fraudulent information by applicants for enrollment in a qualified health plan.  (Sec. 1002) Default Prevention Act of 2013 - Allows the President, within three days after enactment of this Act, to certify to Congress that absent a suspension of the public debt limit, the Secretary of the Treasury would be unable to issue debt to meet existing commitments. Suspends the debt limit for the period beginning on the date on which the President submits to Congress such a certification and ending on February 7, 2014.  Increases the debt limit, effective February 8, 2014, to the extent that:  the face amount of such obligations outstanding on the date of enactment of this Act is exceeded by the total of the face amount of public debt obligations and the face amount of obligations whose principal and interest are guaranteed by the U.S. government (except guaranteed obligations held by the Secretary of the Treasury) outstanding on such date.   Excludes an obligation under clause 2 (above) from being taken into account unless its issuance was necessary to fund a commitment incurred that required payment before February 8, 2014.  Establishes procedures for congressional disapproval, by enactment of a joint resolution within 22 days after receipt of a certification by the President, of the exercise of authority to suspend the debt limit under this Act. Includes in such a measure an alternate debt limit suspension period. Provides for expedited consideration of such a joint resolution in the House and Senate.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on October 16, 2013.

The owner or operator of a transmission or distribution facility, after notifying Interior or USDA, as appropriate, may also conduct vegetation management activities on federal lands to meet clearance requirements under standards established by the Electric Reliability Organization or by state and local authorities. An owner or operator of a transmission or distribution facility shall not be held liable for wildfire damage, loss, or injury, including the cost of fire suppression, if Interior or USDA fails to allow it to:  operate consistently with an approved vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan on federal lands within or adjacent to a right-of-way to comply with federal, state, or local electric system reliability and fire safety standards; or  perform vegetation management activities in response to a hazard tree or a tree in imminent danger of contacting the owner's or operator's transmission or distribution facility.
